Author: Sarah Ogris-Kaltenhauser, 01622878, TU Vienna

This experiment is structured in the following format: 
- folder "code": This folder includes the code which can be used to reproduce the output files from the input files
- folder "input data": These are the raw input datafiles that have not been changed
- folder "metadata": This folder includes a subfolder structure, as the metadata has been provided also for the raw input files of the allegheny dataset. Thus, this folder consists of the subfolders
	- "input data": Including the two metadata files of the input file of the allegheny dataset
	- "output data": We have two metadata files including the names of the columns, the data type of the columns and a description of the column's content.
- folder "output data": This folder consists of the 4 output files that are created: 
	1) The aggregated and cleaned datafile for the Allegheny dataset
	2) The aggregated and cleaned datafile for the Melbourne dataset
	3) the correlation matrix for the Allegheny datafile
	4) the correlation matrix for the Melbourne datafile

The naming convention for the output files is as follows: 
- excel-based file: "country timestamp.xlsx"
- png file: "CorrMatrixCountry timestamp.png"

In addition, a metadata file of the repository will be uploaded and made available.
